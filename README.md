# Proximal Policy Optimization for 2048

## Packages
You'll need the OpenAI gym package and the [2048](https://github.com/activatedgeek/gym-2048) gym environment.

## Layout
`src` contains all the files you'll need. There are also comments on each function in the skeleton we've defined to help you identify their purpose.

Files

| File Name | Purpose |
| - | - |
| `train.py` | Holds code for training and collecting data from the environment. |
| `model.py` | Holds model definition |
| `loss.py` | Holds code for the PPO objective function |
